      Karim Benzema struck a landmark goal as Real Madrid lifted the UEFA Super
      Cup for the fifth time in their history with a comfortable 2-0 victory
      over Eintracht Frankfurt at the Olympic Stadium in Helsinki. The French
      forward, who was the inspirational force behind Real's Champions League
      triumph last season, netted the second goal of the night 25 minutes from
      time to secure the trophy and move him into second spot on Madrid’s list
      of all-time leading goalscorers. Los Blancos had dominated for long spells
      and took the lead on 37 minutes when David Alaba touched home Casemiro’s
      nod back after the Bundesliga outfit had failed to deal with a corner.

      chances go begging while Daichi Kamada blew Frankfurt’s best opportunity
      of the first period when he shot too close to Thibaut Courtois following a
      clever counter attack. The German side had been beaten 6-1 by Bayern
      Munich in their Bundesliga opener and looked a shadow of the team that had
      fearlessly charged to Europa League glory last season.
